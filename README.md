## Alana Anderson: Engineering Manager

Support Class: Druid Cleric


## What I value / What to expect from me
- Supporting engineers
  - Keep engineers working efficiently and aiding in their professional growth.
  - Lead & empower engineers to do their best work
  - Engineers are the experts. I trust them to do their job and do what’s right for the CM codebase/product.
- Our product. I’m a CM fan, and the way I see it is: if it doesn’t serve our shops/users - it doesn’t serve us.
- I loathe shortcuts, disorganization and dishonesty. 
  - On the opposite side of things: 
    - I admire going the extra mile. It’s about doing things the right way, or not at all.
    - Organization leads to focus. Focus leads to effective deliverables.
    - I will always be honest. To a fault. You might not like what I have to say. 
- I hate seeing people struggle with something or get rabbit holed. 
  - Please reach out know if you you need assistance, a rubber duck, brainstorm session, research partner, etc.
  - When I miss a deadline, I feel gross. I’ve come to terms with the fact that this is unlikely to change. I will do my best to drop everything to make sure that doesn’t happen to others.
- Feedback. I value it immensely even if it’s a hard pill to swallow. 
  - Please don’t sugar coat, I sure won’t.
  - I will give you timely, actionable feedback.
- Processes, Processes, Processes 👏 I’m the type of person that enjoys organizing others & processes in creating effective teams.
  - If something isn’t working or broken please let me know.
  - If you’ve got an idea for process improvement, I’ll want to hear it.


## What I expect from our engineers
- I have extremely high expectations for deliverables. Everyone else should strive for the same results. I cannot see the other side of the argument regarding this topic. Sorry.
- To own the thing. Be the expert in the room.
  - I think we do our best work when we own it :successkid: Accountability works wonders for professional growth.
- Feedback
  - Relay it! The good, the bad, the ugly.
- To be growth minded
  - Have goals in mind and general desire to expand your skill set
  - With each project be open to the possibility of learning something new
- To be team Orientated
  - Communicative, collaborative, and respectful.
  - Don’t be shitty
- Share the responsibility of making CM better for our shops/users
  - If you have an opinion or see an issue with a project, please speak up.
  - We’re all in this together.


## How I communicate
- I prefer Slack communication over email.
  - I have Slack with me wherever I go.
- 1:1’s = zoom calls
  - I also really like jumping in on a zoom to help brainstorm, discuss processes & projects, etc. 
- I keep my consistent work hours from 9-6pm Eastern time, but honestly I stay at my desk well beyond those hours.
- I’ll always check in, even if it’s just to say hello and catch up.
- If I don’t get my point across the first time, I’ll circle back.
- If the 🗓️ Slack Status is up, I may be delayed in responding to any messages. Rest assured; I will not forget about you.
- I don’t have to be right. I enjoy healthy debates especially regarding topics I’m super passionate about. 


## Weaknesses
- I can over-organize & can set too many processes.
  - If it’s too much; please push back.
- I can sometimes get tunnel vision.
- I slow down if I miss coffee time.


## Work Style
- I wake up every day and every day starts at zero. All of the progress I made the day before doesn’t count. This helps in prioritizing and setting my goals for the day.
- The longer I work and the later I stay up, the more energized I feel. 
  - I don’t expect others to work late/do the same.
- I’m a note-taker. While on a zoom call, I may look away from the screen to quickly note something I found interesting/important.
  - I hate forgetting things (it happens) so this helps.
- Build → Measure → Learn → Move Forward
- If I’m quiet, I’m most likely deep in thought trying to solve/work something out in my head.

## About Me
- Family comes first. And yes, I include furry animal babies in that “family” bucket as well.
  - My husband’s name is Eric (he’s a chill dude).
  - We have 4 rescues. 1 dog and 3 cats. 
- I’m a HUGE fan of Creative Market. Before joining the team, I would stay up late browsing fonts and graphics for various side projects.
- I’m extremely self motivated.
- I was a full-stack engineer in a past life.
- Myers-Brigg personality test = ESTJ
  - I’m smack dab in the middle of introvert/extravert. Too much socialization burns me out and too little makes me feel like I’m not doing enough.

- I hate celery, cilantro and cinnamon.
- I’m always learning (it’s an addiction). 
- I’m a “hobbyist” Video games, houseplants, bugs/insects, reading, long-boarding, tinkering with gadgets, development, listening to 5by5 podcasts, rowing, 3D printing, cooking, hiking, boardgames, D&D + building/painting miniatures.
